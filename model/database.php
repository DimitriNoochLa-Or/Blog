// Classes are used for representing data as objects 
//this replaces all the functions used a couple times
//the class database contains attributes
//using a class allows all the variables and code to be called my one class
//without using a class there is a bunch of code that coders can mess with at will
//to sum up we use classes to replace overused functions allowing the code to look 
//more organized and understandable
class Database{
	private $connection;
	//private can  means we can only access this variable here not in other files
	private $host;
	private $username;
	private $password;
